## Economics
 - **The Economics of Social Network Interoperability**  
   Recent Project for Economics of Information and Technology (@MIT Sloan)  
   We present variants of classical models of industrial organization and information economics adapted to questions of social network interoperability. We discuss predictions concerning the role of the value of second impressions for cross-side subsidies in two-sided markets, information sharing in platform competition, and the role of compatibility policies for innovation incentives.

 - **Exploiting the Computational Burden**. 
   Recent Project for Complexity and Simplicity in Economics (@Harvard Economics)  
   This model combines auction design with a search component. Auctioneers design a menu measure, from which agents repeatedly sample. We find that auctioneers have incentives to provide menu measures that correspond to non-optimal menus in a Myersonian benchmark. We relate the ability to exploit the sampling of agents to monotonicity properties in the model.

 - **Voting with Restricted Communication**  
   Andreas Haupt  
   Master Project in Economics  
   This project characterised voting rules in the presence of a severe restriction and highlights differences between results for single-peaked and single-crossing preference domains

 - **Technical Results on the $\varepsilon$-BIC Pareto Frontier**  
   Andreas Haupt  
   Term Project for Topics in Microeconomic Theory (Benny Moldovanu)  
   This term paper proved structural results on Pareto frontiers from a paper from [Mennle and Seuken '15](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05883) and introduced a notion of convergence of Pareto frontiers.

 - **Stationary Bargaining on Networks and Bargaining Power**  
   Andreas Haupt, Lasse Stötzer  
   Term Project for Topics in Microeconomic Theory  
   This paper introduced Bargaining power through death of agents in a stationary bargaining model on networks from [Menea AER '11](https://economics.mit.edu/files/11184).

## Computer Science
 - **Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams and Commitment**  
   Andreas Haupt  
   Bachelor Project at the chair of Systemic Risk  
   We introduce an extension of multi-agent influence diagrams that allows for commitment of agents and provide reductions from the problem of computing equilibria in multi-agent influence diagrams with commitment to the computation of equilibria in ordinary multi-agent influence diagrams.

## Mathematics
 - **A Data Application of Graphon Theory**  
   Andreas Haupt, Ngoc Mai Tran, Mohammad Khatami, Thomas Schultz  
   Proceedings of the AWM Research Symposium 2020  
   This project proved a novel stability bound for motif statistics when graphs come from an exchangeable distribution. It applies the theoretically justified statistics to a neuroscience classification task.

 - **Greedy Approximation Guarantees for Generalized Weakly Submodular Functions**  
   Andreas Haupt  
   Research Project at the EPFL chair for Discrete Optimisation  
   We proved a conjectured statement in [Borodin et al. '14](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.6697.pdf) and used this to find a generalisation of the function class introduced in their paper that also allows for a constant-factor approximation.
