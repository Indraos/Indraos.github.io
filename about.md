Hi, I'm Andy. I studied mathematics and economics at the university of Bonn and [EPF Lausanne](epfl.ch), working on (combinatorial) optimisation, exchangeable graphs, game theory and mechanism design. Presently, I am working at a school in central Germany as Fellow of [Teach First Deutschland](teachfirst.de).

This blog has three categories of posts: **teaching** are short descriptions of how I use tools in lessons; **learning** features machine learning and math-related posts, **deciding** social scientific posts. Happy reading.
