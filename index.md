Andreas Haupt is a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/)'s [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [Digital Economy Lab](https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/). He earned his Ph.D. from [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) in Fall 2024. He holds master's degrees in Economics and Mathematics from the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/de/startseite). Before his postdoc, he served at the [U.S. Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/), contributed to the [EUâ€™s antitrust team for platform regulation](https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/index_en) and taught [high-school mathematics](https://www.bsgg.net/). His current research seeks to improve expressions of human preference in human systems, and understand how AI is used productively.
