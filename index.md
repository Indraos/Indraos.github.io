I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in [Engineering-Economic Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017602544) at the [CS and AI Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu) and the [College of Computing](https://computing.mit.edu), [MIT](https://mit.edu). I study **algorithmic accountability in economic context**, by combining real-world data with **economic** theory and **computation** to improve how algorithms interact with their users. My supervisors [Alessandro Bonatti](https://www.mit.edu/~bonatti/) and [Dylan Hadfield-Menell](https://engineering.mit.edu/faculty/dylan-hadfield-menell/) guide me through this adventure. I care about social and environmental sustainability, which influences some parts of my work.
