There are plenty of productivity software helpers. This one shows a calendar app, a biorythm helper, a reference manager and a todo app. 
<!--more-->
## Calendar
Use your system's calendar! Having your dates wherever you are frees your mind for important stuff. Use functionality that most programs have: 

 - Set a *descriptive* title
 - Set the *location*, i.e. exactly where the event will take place.
 - If it is a regular one, set *repeat weekly* or something similar. 
 - If there is a document you are going to need in the meeting or notes *attach it* to the event.
 - In many systems you can also set your *time travelling*. This is sometimes helpful as the time in train etc. is available for work (or whatever you like to do).

## F.lux - Helping your biorythm
[F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/faq.html#install) changes the color settings of screens you are working with when it gets late. You enter your time zone and starting early in the evening, the screen will be more and more saturated with red. At midnight and some hours in front of the laptop you will notice a difference (at least I do): One gets tired earlier and is up the next day earlier as well.

## Reference Management
This might be more relevant for you in the future than now, but having masses of (pdf) references makes it hard to see clear. Programs like [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) allow you to add pdfs and annotate them.

## Todo Programs
I mention features of two todo apps I use: [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) and [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/). Both have similar features, that are very helpful: 
 - Setting a due time and date: The two apps can extract this from text you enter.
 - Assigning it to a project: Projects are collections of tasks that are related. These allow you to have an overview of all tasks (no matter when they are due) that are related to something in your life.
 - Assigning tags: Sometimes, you want to have tags, e.g. @5min for a short task, @mail for one that involves writing an e-mail or @important and @urgent to classify with the [Eisenhower Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method). This latter feature is to my best knowledge only supported by Todoist, but might be included in the future.

In addition, attaching files to todos is possible. Unfortunately, this is as well a pro feature.

### One example
Let us go through an example in Todoist. You note that you have to do homework for tomorrow and you assume its short. You already have a project "school" with subproject "maths". The homework is due tomorrow and you assume it to be short. You were sent the worksheet via e-mail. Then you just need to hit the `+`-icon and write

> Math Homework tomorrow @5min #maths

and the label @5min, due date tomorrow and subproject #maths will be set automatically. A todo item will appear and a speech bubble close to the right end of the todo. Clicking there will allow you to comment on the todo with text and to upload files.[^The feature to have labels and comments (hence also the feature file uploads) are only possible for pro.]

### Advantages of Wunderlist
Wunderlist allows you to share lists with other persons even in the free version very easily and to assign todos. This is very helpful when collaborating on a project. Also, in the free version, you can upload a restricted number of files for each todo.
