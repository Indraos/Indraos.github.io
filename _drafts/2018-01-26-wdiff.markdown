## Problem Statement
You have students that all own a smartphone but do not have access to a computer. You collect homework in a way that allows students to send text in a realistic fashion: via e-mail. How to efficiently correct the texts and give them feedback via e-mail?

## Solution
This solution made for a unix shell. If you do not know how to open one, this is probably not for you. Except for that, I do not assume prior knowledge and give you steps to follow along. 
### Version Control
Create a new directory `homeworks` and start a git repository by 
```
git init
```
Git is a version control system that allows you to store past versions of files. We will use it to store corrections of the texts.
### Fetching the Mails at a Certain time
First install with your package manager the command line programs `at` and `mailfetch` and `wdiff` (the latter we will need later). `at` is a program that allows to automatise the execution of certain actions.

Commit to your changes by putting 
```
commit -m "Homework 1 raw texts"
```
### Correcting the text. 
Let us start at the end: You have a directory `homework1` -- the first homework you handed out, with text files `[email-address-of-student]`.
### Getting a version of changes
Commit the changes again:
```
